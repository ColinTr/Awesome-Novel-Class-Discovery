# Awesome-Novel-Class-Discovery 

Novel Class Discovery (NCD) is a machine learning problem, where novel categories of instances are to be automatically discovered from an unlabelled pool. In contrast to clustering, NCD setting has access to labelled data from a disjoint set of classes. This topic has plausible real-world applications and is gathering much attention in the research community.  

Here, we provide a non-exhaustive list of papers that studies NCD.
